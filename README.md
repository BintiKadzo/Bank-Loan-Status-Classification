# Bank Loan Status Classification

# 1. Project Description
## a) Specifying the Question

We intended to build a classification model that assesses certain specifics of the client's information for example the clientâ€™s current income, credit score, the purpose of the loan with the help of (specific) certain Machine learning algorithms to classify the data into either a good loan application or a bad loan application. This in turn helps the bank predict which loan applications to grant. We will therefore build several models and select the one that works best.

## b) Defining the Metric for Success

Our study will be considered successful if we are able to meet the below objectives.

Main Objective

To find the groups of people applying for loans in banks at an individual level by building an unsupervised clustering model.

Specific Objectives

i.) To determine the characteristics responsible for customer loan classification through feature selection. 
ii.) To determine the maximum loan limit for certain clients based on these features. 
iii.) To check for anomalies in the number of open accounts by an individual. 
iv.) To make a prediction on whether a client is likely to pay off their loan or not. v.) To determine the most common purpose for loan application.

## c) Understanding the context

Loan classification, risk management, and provisioning processes are closely intertwined in a bank's operations. Loan pricing, the frequency and intensity of review and analysis, the rigor of monitoring, and the tolerance for loan losses (which should be precisely proportional to the risk rating grade) are all determined by the characteristics of the various risk rating classes. They are associated with the amount of risk indicated by a loan's assigned risk rating grade), and the amount of risk indicated by the amount of risk to absorb unforeseen losses, regulatory capital is essential. When loan classification systems are combined with management's ability to recognize negative trends, there is an improved decision making process through portfolio management and early reporting techniques.

A loan classification system is an important component of a bank's credit risk assessment and valuation process, as it classifies loans and groups of loans with comparable credit risk characteristics into risk categories. Underwriting and approval, monitoring and managing credit quality, early identification of adverse trends and potentially problem loans, loan loss provisioning, management reporting, and the determination of regulatory capital requirements are all areas where a loan classification system can be useful. Loan classification systems are recognized by both accounting frameworks and Basel II/III regulatory capital frameworks as suitable instruments for accurately assessing credit risk and establishing groupings of loans for collective evaluation for loan loss calculation
